## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **New `surreal_sdk` module** - Custom Python SDK for SurrealDB independent of the official `surrealdb` package
  - `HTTPConnection` - Stateless HTTP-based connection, ideal for microservices and serverless
  - `WebSocketConnection` - Stateful WebSocket connection for real-time features and Live Queries
  - `ConnectionPool` - Connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios
  - `LiveQuery` and `LiveQueryManager` - Real-time Live Query subscriptions (WebSocket only)
  - `ChangeFeedStream` and `MultiTableChangeFeed` - CDC pattern for stateless microservices (HTTP)
  - `RPCRequest`, `RPCResponse`, `RPCError` - RPC protocol layer

- **Strongly-typed response classes** (replacing `Any` returns)
  - `QueryResponse` / `QueryResult` - For query operations
  - `RecordResponse` / `RecordsResponse` - For record CRUD operations
  - `AuthResponse` - For signin/signup authentication
  - `InfoResponse` - For database info operations
  - `DeleteResponse` - For delete operations
  - `LiveQueryId` - For live query UUID handling
  - `ResponseStatus` - Enum for OK/ERR status

- **Exception classes** for SDK
  - `SurrealDBError`, `ConnectionError`, `AuthenticationError`
  - `QueryError`, `TimeoutError`, `LiveQueryError`, `ChangeFeedError`

### Changed

- **🚀 ORM now uses custom SDK** - Removed dependency on official `surrealdb` package
  - `SurrealDBConnectionManager` now uses `HTTPConnection` from `surreal_sdk`
  - All ORM methods adapted to use typed responses (`RecordResponse`, `RecordsResponse`, etc.)
  - Removed `surrealdb>=0.4.1` from dependencies

- **Python version support**: Now requires Python 3.12+ (dropped 3.11, added 3.14)
- Updated `pyproject.toml` classifiers and tool configurations for Python 3.12/3.13/3.14
- Coverage threshold reduced to 35% to accommodate new SDK code

### Removed

- **Dependency on `surrealdb` package** - No longer required, fully replaced by custom `surreal_sdk`

### Fixed

- ID parsing from SurrealDB format (`table:id` → `id`)
- Test isolation with dedicated model classes per test
